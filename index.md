## Welcome to my portfolio!

### Roblox Builder and Designer

**Hey, I am MrAhmalo a 14 year old guy from Germany!
I started to learn about Roblox Studio, Scripting, Building, Modelling and that stuff 2 Years ago.
I have lots of experience in Terrain and Designing (for example an GUI).**

**And yeah I know my account says its created 1 year ago, but this is not my first account since I lost the data of my old one.**

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/MrAhmalo/roblox-portfolio/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/MrAhmalo/roblox-portfolio/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
