# Roblox Builder and Designer

Hey, I am MrAhmalo a 14 year old guy from Germany!
I started to learn about Roblox Studio, Scripting, Building, Modelling and that stuff 2 Years ago.
I have lots of experience in Terrain and Designing (for example an GUI).

And yeah I know my account says its created 1 year ago, but this is not my first account since i lost the data of my old one.
